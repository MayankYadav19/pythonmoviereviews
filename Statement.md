Problem Statement

Manual documentation or scattered notes make managing movies and their reviews very tedious. Thus, the user needs a convenient way to store, fetch, and comment on movies using a single interface that automates movie information retrieval and saving of local reviews.



Overview of the Project



The project enables users to search for movies, fetch movie details from the OMDb API, and store both movie records and reviews in a local SQLite database. The system will include basic functionalities such as adding movies and reviews and retrieving the details of movies for personal archiving or sharing.
